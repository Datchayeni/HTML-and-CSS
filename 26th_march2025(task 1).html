                <h3>Lucky Bay is a bay located on the south coast of Western Australia, in the Cape Le Grand National Park. 
                    Located southeast of Esperance, the bay is a tourist spot known for its bright white sands and turquoise-colored waters.Matthew Flinders had sailed 
                    into the hazardous Archipelago of the Recherche, and he found his ship surrounded by islands and rocks with nightfall coming on. He named this area 
                    "Lucky Bay" when his vessel HMS Investigator took refuge after a summer storm

                <p><h3>Railay, also known as Rai Leh, is a small peninsula between the city of Krabi and Ao Nang in Thailand. It is accessible only by boat due to 
                    high limestone cliffs cutting off mainland access. These cliffs attract rock climbers from all over the world, but the area is also popular due to 
                    its beautiful beaches and quiet relaxing atmosphere. Accommodation ranges from bungalows and medium-priced resorts in East Railay to a collection of 
                    luxury resorts focused on West Railay, though one, Royavadee, spans both waterfronts and also has a beachfront restaurant at Ao Phra Nang.</h3></p>
