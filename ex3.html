    Japanese-language studio albums, Dark & Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings 
    (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market and 
    led the Korean Wave into the United States, becoming the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the 
    Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first act from South Korea to 
    top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018).<br> <hr>

In 2020, BTS became the fastest group since the Beatles to chart four US number-one albums in less than two years, with 
Love Yourself: Answer (2018) becoming the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same year, they also became 
the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their 
Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Follow-up releases "Savage Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter", and "Permission to Dance"
 made them the fastest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.</p>
