    Be is the fifth Korean-language and ninth overall studio album by South Korean boy band BTS. It was released on November 20, 2020, through Big Hit Entertainment, 
    nine months after its predecessor, Map of the Soul: 7 (2020). Created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Be was inspired by BTS's perspective of life during the 
    pandemic. The record sees the band members contributing to various aspects of album-making process including songwriting, development, production, and visual design.

    Be is primarily a pop record, encompassing hip hop, EDM, and disco genres with elements of synth-pop, funk, and R&B. Described by BTS as "a letter of hope", the 
    lyrics are about comfort, loneliness, anxiety, sadness, hope, connection, and joy. Critics hailed the album's pop sound and the eclectic experimentation of musical 
    styles, with many praising its authenticity and simplicity. A few others expressed mixed feelings and found it unadventurous. The album was preceded by the standalone 
    single "Dynamite", which marked BTS's first number-one song on the US Billboard Hot 100. It was followed by the lead single of Be, "Life Goes On", which also debuted 
    atop the Hot 100, becoming BTS's third consecutive chart-topper in the United States.<br>
    
    The album was BTS's fifth to debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making BTS the fastest group to earn five chart-topping albums in the United States since the 
    Beatles. Elsewhere, the album topped charts in Canada, Denmark, Japan, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Korea, and Wallonia; 
    and peaked within the top 10 of 14 other territories. The album has since been certified triple million by the Korea Music Content Association (KMCA) and platinum by
     the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). BTS promoted Be with performances at the American Music Awards and television programs, including The Late Late 
     Show with James Corden.<br><br><br>
     Background<br>
     BTS released their fourth Korean-language studio album, Map of the Soul: 7, in February 2020, to critical and commercial acclaim. In support of the album, the 
     band was slated to begin the concert tour, Map of the Soul Tour in April 2020, but the tour was postponed following the COVID-19 pandemic. During a YouTube 
     broadcast, band member RM revealed that BTS were working on a new album. He hinted that they would be sharing the preparation process of the forthcoming album 
     through subsequent self-documented videos as part of their initiative to interact with the fans during the lockdown. In subsequent broadcasts, it was revealed 
     that the album would be written and produced by the band members. In addition to writing songs for the album, the band members were heavily involved in the 
     overall production process, undertaking the role of project managers in various fields, which included developing concepts, themes, as well as its visual design. Jimin was
     responsible for A&R, acting as a link between the group and their management label. Suga, V, and J-Hope handled the production together with Jin and Jungkook; the 
     latter was also responsible for directing the music video. V and RM supervised the graphics and design of the album. Speaking about the album in an interview with 
     Teen Vogue, BTS stated: "An increase of direct participation in the album-making process allowed us to explore more aspects of our music and creativity."</p>
