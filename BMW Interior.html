The narrow LED headlights, elegant curves, spaceship-style rear lights and distinctive flying buttresses all make for a low-slung car with more presence than almost anything else on the road; laser headlights are optional, delivering an even more penetrating and bright beam pattern than the LEDs do – themselves a fairly recent development in headlights.<br>As a result, you’ll need to get used to being the centre of attention, because the i8 is a car that attracts a constant stream of camera phone wielding car fans. The colour palette is relatively small, however, varying from silver to a far more eye-catching electric blue and black. Some are more eccentric than others owing to brightly coloured accents, but BMW has resisted the urge to offer garish paint tones.<br>Whatever you choose, the options list contains exterior detailing such as contrasting coloured trim for the skirts and grille, and there are multiple wheel choices, albeit only in 20-inch size to accommodate the unusually thin bespoke tyres.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Despite the futuristic leaning of the dashboard design, the infotainment is lifted directly from the BMW parts shelf, meaning you’re dealing with roughly the same iDrive system that everyone from a MINI through a 5 Series driver uses. It’s one of the few disappointments of an otherwise sublime cabin – iDrive’s rotary dial control system remains unintuitive.<br>
It does however come with a 20GB hard drive for loading music onto, and fittingly it’s the latest and most top-end version of the system available (until the 2016 BMW 7 Series arrives, that is), so it includes a host of extra features like real time traffic information and BMW’s Concierge service. A head-up display is standard, but internet functionality costs £95, while a Harman/Kardon stereo upgrade (recommended) costs about ten times that. The arrival of the i8 Roadster that brought about the Coupe's facelift in 2018 also saw the infotainment system upgraded, while a head-up display was added to the options list.
