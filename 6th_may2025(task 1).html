                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Hello there! I’m Luna Lovegood — naturalist, seeker of the unseen, and lifelong believer in the curious wonders of the world. A Ravenclaw through 
                        and through (Hogwarts, Class of 1999), I’ve always marched to the beat of a Nargle’s wings and encouraged others to embrace their unique magic.
                        <br>
                        At Hogwarts, I was known for my unconventional views, radish earrings, and unwavering loyalty to my friends (especially during the formation of 
                        Dumbledore’s Army). My affinity for magical creatures and openness to new perspectives helped me see beyond what most dared to believe.
                        <br>
                        After school, I became a magizoologist, traveling far and wide to document rare species, dispel myths, and advocate for the misunderstood beings 
                        of our world. I currently contribute to The Quibbler (now an award-winning magical journal), write dream poetry, and occasionally speak on topics 
                        like spectral empathy and wrackspurt defense.
                        <br>
                        Welcome to my cloud of thoughts — where logic meets stardust.
