<p>BMW i8 is the first production car in the world that was shipped with laser light headlights. We went to Marseille, France, to see the i8 lasers in action and the dark night on the Cote d’Azur is the perfect backdrop to see what the powerful lights can do.<br>

Both low beam and high beam are using the LEDs, the laser spot serves as sort of power beam and is only activated automatically when the high beam automatic does not detect the area road for more than ​600 meters and you’re driving at least 70 km/h fast.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Laser diodes are ten times smaller than conventional light diodes. They help to save not only available installation space inside the headlamp, but also weight. The size of the reflector surface can be reduced by a factor of up to ten vs. LED light.When testing the laser lights, we noticed that even at 300 meters ranges, the LED high beams are sufficient to properly illuminate the road. Yet, when using the two laser lights, the darkness in front of you becomes daylight.</p>
