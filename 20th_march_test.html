            <h4>Coffee cake is cake intended to be eaten with, or flavored with, coffee. British coffee cake is a sponge cake flavoured with coffee.<br><br>

                They are generally round and consist of two layers separated by coffee flavoured butter icing, which also covers the top of the cake.<br><br>
                
                Walnuts are a common addition to coffee cakes. So focused is this foodstuff on being paired with coffee, you canâ€™t order one without implicitly mentioning the other. It is not too flaky and not too sweet; it can be said to be just perfect for coffee.</h4><br><br><br>
            <li>Cheese cake</li>

            <h4>cheesecake and coffee is a match made in heaven. The soft creaminess of the sweet and salty cheesecake perfectly balances the strong, sharp and bitter taste of coffee.<br><br><br>

                Out of the numerous cheesecakes that you can offer our customers with their coffee, the best one is certainly the cheesecake brownie.</h4><br><br><br>
            <li>Macaroons</li>
